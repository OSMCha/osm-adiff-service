# osm-adiff-service

This service is intended to create full representations of OpenStreetMap changesets. It needs to listen to minutely changeset replication files and query changeset data in overpass, so both datasets can be merged together.

# Real OpenStreetMap Changesets

When a changeset is pushed to OSM, this stack builds a representation of the exact change that happened:

* Changeset metadata - username, id, timestamp, comment etc.
* Elements - each feature that was added, modified, or deleted in the changeset.
* For each element, the current and previous version including geometry and metadata.

#### Details

* New changesets are pushed to `https://s3.amazonaws.com/mapbox/real-changesets/production/<changeset-id>.json`
* Augmented Diffs are pushed by Ovepass are pushed to `https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/overpass-db-ap-northeast-1/augmented-diffs/<state-id.osc>`. 
* The latest state id is published here `https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/overpass-db-ap-northeast-1/augmented-diffs/latest`

#### Example

```json
// 20170309131154

## What is this, and why?

A lot of processes around inspecting and searching for potentially bad edits on OpenStreetMap depend on being able to view a "changeset" in its entirety. This helps in gauging the context of an edit, see similar edits by the same user, and see edits in their "finished" state (i.e. not in between a changeset).

Our primary tool for visualizing changesets has been [changeset-map](http://osmlab.github.io/changeset-map/). We depend on [augmented diffs](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Augmented_Diffs) generated by Overpass to generate these changeset representations and visualizations.

Augmented Diffs contains complete representations of changes in OSM for every minute. One can also query for a custom time range, and filter by bounding box or other attributes. These queries can be extremely slow, especially for large changesets, and were a major bottleneck in scaling up changeset reviewing processes.

### How to fill a missing changeset

To backfill a particular changeset
- Make sure you have authorized via `mbx auth <mfa_code>`.
- Run `node backfill <stack_name> <changeset_id> <?padding>`
- It might take a while for the command to run.

__Params__

`stack` :<required> production | staging | etc

`changeset_id`: <required> Only accepts one changeset id

`padding`: <optional> The range of minutely replication files to look for the changeset id in. eg. `[239.osc.gz, (239+padding).osc.gz]`


### This sounds like quite a lot of duct-tape

It is. For now, this is going to improve our workflows, but while this in place we can continue working on Dynamosm.
